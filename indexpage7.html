      <p> 30 still-life paintings by 17th-century Dutch artist Pieter Claesz were included in this first international exhibition of his work, along with 6 still lifes by his predecessors and contemporaries Floris van Dijck, Willem Claesz Heda, Gerret Willemsz Heda, Osias Beert the Elder, and Jan Brueghel the Elder. Decorative objects and books from the period were displayed in cases in the Dutch Cabinet Galleries. Among them was the gilt cup of the Haarlem brewer's guild, which appears in one of the Claesz paintings in the exhibition. The exhibition was a variant of the earlier presentations in Haarlem and ZÃ¼rich.</p>
